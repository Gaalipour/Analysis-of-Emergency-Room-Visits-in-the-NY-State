# Analysis-of-Emergency-Room-Visits-in-the-NY-State
These notebooks written in R markdown (by RStudio) form the first part of my summer internship projects. Due to privacy and the company policies, I couldn't bring my code for the second part of the internship. In the second part of my internship I worked on the internal data and that's why I do not have my results here. 

I made my presentations for both parts in a Shiny dahsboard of R. Here is a picture of my dashboard concering the public data.
